# Stroke-Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict strokes based on user data. Feed the User input such as Gender, Age, Smoking Status, etc. The Model analyze your input and produce the output. The model is trained with Five machine learning algorithms, namely Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, KDD. The final model is deployed on a website using Flask in Python.

## Data Cleaning and EDA

The dataset is retrieved from Kaggle and underwent thorough cleaning to ensure accuracy using Excel, and EDA (exploratory data analysis) was performed to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that informed the subsequent modeling process. Outliers are removed and the dataset is Normalized to train the model. 

## Model Deployment

The trained model is deployed on a website using Flask in Python, making it accessible for real-time predictions. Templates are used for the Website to improve its User Experience.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the project by modifying the website Templates and also include other Machine Learning Algorithms to train the model.
